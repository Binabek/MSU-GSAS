This is a document of where to look to start learning how to use machine learning.

Start learning to use ML: I reccomend following this tutorial. Will take around 1-3 months, but it goes in depth on how to use 
different parts of an NN or a CNN and such.

Using ML for Accelerators: This is a good overview of all the current topics of machine learning for accelerators.

Using tensorflow vs pytorch:
tensorflow: easier to learn and fast to implement simple concepts. Hides a bit of stuff to make things high level.
pytorch: what most researcher uses and eiser to make more complicated and custom models. Higher learning curve, but it is 
easier to understand how everyting works since it makes you do more things.
